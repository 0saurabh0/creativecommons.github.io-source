      <h1>How to find our projects and how to report bugs</h1>

      <p>As you'll see, we have a lot of repositories on GitHub, and most of them aren't software but projects we're working on a CC.</p>

      <p>If you have a comment or suggestion, you can usually file an
      issue on that project. However, feel free to leave issues for
      anything related to Creative Commons on the
      main <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/creativecommons.org/issues">creativecommons.org
	  issue tracker</a>.</p>

      <h2>Filing a bug</h2>

      <p>You'll need a GitHub account to proceed.</p>

      <ol>
	<li>Open a <a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/creativecommons.org/issues/new" target="_blank">new issue on GitHub</a></li>
	<li>Give us as much detail as you can, and if you can, please attach a screenshot. <a href="http://www.take-a-screenshot.org/" target="_blank">take-a-screenshot.org/</a> has instructions on taking screenshots.</li>
        	<li>You're all set!</li>
