# Technology at Creative Commons

Our core mission at Creative Commons includes [supporting technical infrastructure to maximize creativity, sharing, and innovation](https://creativecommons.org/about/mission-and-vision/) and we've been building free software to that end for more than a decade. That's a lot of projects and the tech team isn't very big so we really appreciate volunteers who are willing to help us build or test our tools and products.

We just started an effort to make individual projects easier to find and contribute to, but for now, you can browse through [the repositories on our main GitHub organization](https://github.com/creativecommons/) to see what we're working on.

## Ways to Get Involved

### Give us feedback about our software

Using our tools (such as [the new CC Search beta](http://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/)) and letting us know how it's working for you is fantastic! We're looking for bug reports, feature requests, general comments â€“ any form of feedback is excellent, no matter how small.

You can send us feedback by [creating a GitHub issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) on the repository corresponding to the project. If you're not sure what that means or you don't know the correct repository, please create an issue [on the main creativecommons.org repository](https://github.com/creativecommons/creativecommons.org/issues). If you don't have a GitHub account, you'll need to make one to do this.

You can also give us feedback in the `#cc-usability` channel [on the CC Slack](https://creativecommons.org/2016/10/18/slack-announcement/).

### Contribute code

We are working on contribution guidelines and documentation for our projects. Watch this space!
