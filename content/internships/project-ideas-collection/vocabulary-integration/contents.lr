title: Integrate Vocabulary with CC Open Source & CCGN websites
---
problem:
Creative Commons has many different websites ([CC.org](https://creativecommons.org/), [CC Global Summit](https://summit.creativecommons.org/), [CC Open Source](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/), [CC Certificates](https://certificates.creativecommons.org/), [CC Global Network](https://network.creativecommons.org/), [CC Chapter Sites](https://de.creativecommons.net/start/), etc.), all of which have different design elements and styles. One of our 2020 goals is to unify them all using our new web design system, [Vocabulary](https://cc-vocabulary.netlify.com/). We need help updating the CC Open Source and CCGN websites.
---
expected_outcome:
*   Updates to the CC Open Source website replacing all styling with components from Vocabulary.
*   Updates to the CC Global Network WordPress theme that build upon our base WordPress theme (this theme is currently in progress) and use components from Vocabulary.
*   Updates to our Figma design library (in collaboration with our UX Designer) and Vocabulary itself for any new components that need to be added when redesigning the sites.
---
internship_tasks:  
*   Create wireframes for the website redesigns using Vocabulary components in Figma
*   Identify new components that need to be added to Vocabulary and work with the UX designer to design and implement them
*   Update the WordPress theme for the CC Global Network website to use Vocabulary exclusively
*   Update the CC Open Source website styling to use Vocabulary exclusively
*   Implement the new components in Vue Vocabulary if time permits
---
application_tips:
It is okay if you think you’ll only have time to do one of the two websites. We’d rather you do one of them well than rush.
