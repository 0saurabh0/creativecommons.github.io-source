title: Improvements to the CC WordPress Plugin
---
problem:
WordPress powers over 25% of websites on the Internet and we'd like to easily enable those websites to license their content under CC licenses. We [released a stable version of the CC WordPress plugin after Google Summer of Code 2019](https://creativecommons.org/2019/11/22/updated-cc-wordpress-plugin/) but we still have a lot of features we would like to add. Major features include internationalization of the plugin, integration with [Vocabulary](https://cc-vocabulary.netlify.com/), classic editor support for licensing content, and perhaps even integrating the [CC Catalog API documentation](https://api.creativecommons.engineering/v1/). We would also like to fix bugs and handle incoming feature requests.
---
expected_outcome:
At least two new releases of the WordPress plugin during the internship period, with internationalization using Transifex, classic editor support, and Vocabulary integration completed. Ideally we'd also like a few other features built, we are open to suggestions.
---
internship_tasks:  
*   Building new features according to the plan agreed upon between you and your mentors
*   Fixing existing and new bugs and making other improvements to the code
*   Releasing the plugin regularly.
---
application_tips:
*   We'd like to know what features you think the WordPress plugin should have other than the ones we've already mentioned
*   You'll get bonus points for showing familiarity with the pluginâ€™s interface or code
