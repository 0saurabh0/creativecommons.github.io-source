title: Add plain text format to CC Legal Tools
---
problem:
Plain text formats for the 4.0 licenses and the CC0 public domain dedication
were created using a manual process ([Plaintext versions of Creative Commons
licenses and CC0 - Creative Commons][blogplaintext]).  Only the English
versions of the legal tools were formatted as plain text.  Additionally, that
manual creation process was not without errors and is not sustainable.

---
expected_outcome:
Extend the CC Legal Tools App to generate deterministic plain text versions of
the 4.0 licenses and the CC0 public domain dedication.
---
contributor_tasks:
The contributor will need to extend the CC Legal Tools App to generate plain
text versions. The generated plain text versions must be deterministic and
match the formatting of the manual versions (except where improvements are
desired). Application updates must include test coverage. Stretch goals include
Markdown format generation and interfacing/collaborating with SPDX.
