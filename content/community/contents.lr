## Slack
Creative Commons has a large Slack community with sub-communities for tech/developers (of course), the [CC Global Network](https://network.creativecommons.org/), specific countries, open education, GLAM, and more. It is open to the public and you can [sign up here](http://slack-signup.creativecommons.org/). If you're not familiar with Slack, please read ["Getting Started" on Slack's usage guide](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/categories/360000049043). Information on joining a specific channel is on ["Join a channel"](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205239967-Join-a-channel).

Once you join, please introduce yourself in the `#cc-developers` channel.

### Slack Tips
- You will automatically join the `#general` and `#cc-announcements` channels when you sign in to Slack for the first time.
    - `#general` is for general purpose discussions relevant to CC.
    - `#cc-announcements` is reserved for important announcements from CC staff.
- For more information about how Creative Commons uses Slack, see [the Slack page on the CC public wiki](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Slack).
- If you're looking to talk to someone on CC's full-time engineering staff, you're most likely to find us on Slack between 11:00 and 23:00 UTC on weekdays.

## IRC
We don't use IRC much, but if you'd like, you can join the `#creativecommons-dev` channel on [Freenode](https://freenode.net/). This channel is mirrored to the `#cc-developers` channel on Slack so that messages posted on Slack show up on IRC and vice-versa.

If you're not familiar with IRC, [here's a good guide to getting started](https://www.wikihow.com/Get-Started-with-IRC-%28Internet-Relay-Chat%29). You can also join using the [Freenode webchat](https://webchat.freenode.net/).
