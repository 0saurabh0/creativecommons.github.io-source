#### Slack
CC has an active Slack community open to the public. [Sign up here](http://slack-signup.creativecommons.org/). Channels relevant to CC's software are:  
* `#cc-developers` â€“ for general technical discussion
* `#cc-gsoc` â€“ for Google Summer of Code related discussion
* `#cc-usability` â€“ for soliciting feedback on new releases from the community

If you're looking to talk to someone on CC's tech team, we are all in the Americas and someone is usually around on Slack between 11:00 and 23:00 UTC.

For information regarding joining a channel on Slack, [look here](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205239967-Join-a-channel).

Note that channels like `#general` on Slack consist of a fair amount of users. While it is a channel for general-purpose discussions, please take into consideration that a post on such a channel might notify thousands of users. ðŸ˜„
