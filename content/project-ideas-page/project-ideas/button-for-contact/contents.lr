title: Allow creators of CC-licensed work to archive their content
---
description:

Prototype a few concepts that provide creators with the choice of archiving a version of their works when CC licensing. This could be an archive we provide as a service, tied to a new chooser tool, a separate web page for preserving your work, and also in partnership with an organization like the Internet Archive.
---
rationale: 

Addresses the following insights from our user research (see the Resources section for link to all insights):  
- People like the efficiency of sharing via centralized platforms, but are frustrated by the lack of control and ownership over their work, and increasing devaluation of individual creativity.  
- People have a desire to create work that is lasting and meaningful, that eventually has a life of its own, but donâ€™t know what to do with a work beyond publishing it.
