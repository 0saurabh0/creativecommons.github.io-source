Creative Commons has been selected as a mentoring organization for [Google Summer of Code 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)! Increasing digital collaboration is one of CC’s primary goals as an organization, so we are very excited by the idea of helping students become acquainted with open communities. Working with us is a good opportunity to work on large and impactful technical challenges and acquire new skills, but you'll also learn what it’s like to work for a nonprofit and help advance our mission to legally share knowledge and creativity to build a more equitable, accessible, and innovative world.

For more information about what Creative Commons as a whole does, please check out the ["What we do" page on our organization website](https://creativecommons.org/about/).
