title: Google Summer of Code 2019
---
body:

Creative Commons has been selected as a mentoring organization for [Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)! Increasing digital collaboration is one of CC’s primary goals as an organization, so we are very excited by the idea of helping students become acquainted with open communities. Working with us is a good opportunity to work on large and impactful technical challenges and acquire new skills, but you'll also learn what it’s like to work for a nonprofit and help advance our mission to legally share knowledge and creativity to build a more equitable, accessible, and innovative world.

For more information about what Creative Commons as a whole does, please check out the ["What we do" page on our organization website](https://creativecommons.org/about/).

## Proposal review criteria

We do not have formal guidelines for reviewing proposals, but here are a few things we consider:
* **Quality of the proposal**: This is the most important thing. A good proposal includes attention to detail, externally measurable milestones, consideration for future maintainability and community involvement, and a demonstration of your skills.
* **Community involvement**: One of our major goals for GSoC is to build an active development community and attract long-term contributors. We see engaging in the community, whether it's asking questions, helping other students, contributing code, filing bugs, or whatever else, as a sign that you're genuinely interested in our work.
* **Code contributions**: We appreciate seeing your code, it helps us gauge your ability to orient yourself to a new codebase, as well as giving us confidence that you have the skills necessary to implement your proposal. Code samples that are not related to CC projects work too, but contributing to CC projects has the added benefits of community involvement.
* **Communication skills and initiative**: These are essential to completing a successful project. Things we look for (among others): asking specific and detailed questions, following up on conversations, making sure to read available resources before asking questions, being patient and responding to critical feedback well.

However, this is all relative. For example. if you have a great proposal, but haven't contributed code to CC yet, you still have a good shot.

## Number of accepted students

We can only accept a fixed number of students, which is determined by the number of slots allocated to
 us by the Google Summer of Code administrators. Even though there are `n` proposals 
on the project ideas page, CC may only be allocated enough project slots to support fewer than `n` projects. 
The number of project slots allocated to each GSoC organization varies by year. 

You can find more information about the slot allocation process in [the GSoC mentor guide][gsoc-slot-allocation].
