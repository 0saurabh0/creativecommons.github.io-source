body:

Creative Commons has been selected as a mentoring organization for [Google Summer of Code 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)! Increasing digital collaboration is one of CC’s primary goals as an organization, so we are very excited by the idea of helping students become acquainted with open communities. Working with us is a good opportunity to work on large and impactful technical challenges and acquire new skills, but you'll also learn what it’s like to work for a nonprofit and help advance our mission to legally share knowledge and creativity to build a more equitable, accessible, and innovative world.

For more information about what Creative Commons as a whole does, please check out the ["What we do" page on our organization website](https://creativecommons.org/about/). 

## First steps

If you are a student interested in submitting a proposal to CC, start by checking out our [Project Ideas](/gsoc-2019/project-ideas/all) page to find an idea that you would like to write a proposal to work on during GSoC. CC mentors are available on [Slack and the developer mailing list](/community) to answer questions and provide feedback.

Before you start writing a proposal, read our [Application Instructions](/gsoc-2019/application-instructions) and [Student Expectations](/gsoc-2019/student-expectations) to get an idea of what we are looking for from students.

### Mentor Availability/ Project Slots
Google assigns Creative Commons (and all GSoC organizations) a fixed number of project slots. This means that there may be `n` proposals on the project ideas page, but CC may be only be allocated enough project slots to support `< n` projects. The number of project slots allocated to each GSoC organization varies by year. 

You can find more information about the slot allocation process in [the GSoC mentor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/selecting-students-and-mentors#the-formal-process).

## Proposal review criteria

We do not have formal guidelines for reviewing proposals, but here are a few things we consider:
* **Quality of the proposal**: This is the most important thing. A good proposal includes attention to detail, externally measurable milestones, consideration for future maintainability and community involvement, and a demonstration of your skills.
* **Community involvement**: One of our major goals for GSoC is to build an active development community and attract long-term contributors. Engaging in the community, whether it's asking questions, helping other students, contributing code, filing bugs, or whatever else, is a good sign that you're actually interested in our work and our projects.
* **Communication skills and initiative**: These are essential to completing a successful project. Things we look for (among others): asking specific and detailed questions, following up on conversations, making sure to read available resources before asking questions, being patient and responding to critical feedback well.
* **Code contributions**: We appreciate seeing your code, it gives us confidence that you have the skills necessary to implement your proposal. Code samples that are not related to CC projects are fine too.
