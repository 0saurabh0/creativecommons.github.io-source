Creative Commons is committed to open-source software. We have over two dozen
projects, spanning thrice as many repositories on GitHub, each with its small,
but extremely enthusiastic, subcommunity. With only a few full-time employees
working on these projects, it is vital that members from the community take
increased responsibility in developing and maintaining them, and growing the
very community of which they are a part.

With that goal in mind, we've launched our Community Teams initiative. Since the
team has just crossed a major milestone with a strength of forty members, I feel
like it would be a good time to talk a little more about this idea.

### What are Community Teams?

Due to the very nature of open-source, communities that grow organically around
projects tend to be a bit disorganised and the frequency of contributions and
degree of involvement tends to vary from member to member. Our goal is to
identify contributors who are actively involved within their communities and
give them increased permissions over the codebase, and access to more
information channels and tools in an effort to nurture them as future
maintainers of that particular project.

This is not restricted to code though. We're also looking for people who work
with the community on other aspects of the projects, such as design,
documentation, evangelism and onboarding to name a few.

- First, they establish a framework for formalising the level of involvement,
  which is a spectrum, into discrete level or 'roles'.

  Community Teams bring a certain order into the community, which is chaotic by
  its very nature. By introducing this concept, we discretise the community into
  strata, which gives us an overview of the sustainability of the community.

- Then they map each role to a set of responsibilities that a member holding the
  role is encouraged to take up.

  Based on how members are familiarising themselves with the code and processes,
  and then volunteering to take up increased responsibilities for the projects
  and communities that they're associated with, we can determine how
  self-sustaining the community can be.

- Each role also entrusts the members holding it to certain privileges, accesses
  and permissions, to help them execute these responsibilities.

  Roles also progressively include members in our roadmaps and planning meetings
  to ensure that the community is aligned with our long-term goals.

### What's in it for me?

Community Teams are not just a one-sided deal. Your membership in the Community
Team is just as beneficial for the you as it is for us. While there is a
[laundry list of benefits][benefits] that you're entitled to, I'll just mention
some notable ones here.

[benefits]:/community/community-team/#benefits-of-joining-the-community-team

- You gain real-world practical experience of working on open-source projects.
- You gain both soft-skills and technical-skills by constantly interacting with
  other developers from both the community as well as CC staff.
- Since we've already seen the quality of your work and involvement with the
  community, you get priority in internship applications*.

Oh and, lest I forget, you'll receive CC swag!

### What are these 'roles'?

If you've reached this point, I assume you see the potential of Community Teams.
Let's see where you'd fit in them.

We have two kinds of roles, code-oriented [Project roles][projectroles], that
give you responsibilities and permissions related to one CC project, and
non-code-oriented [Community Building roles][communitybuildingroles], that give
you responsibilities and permissions related to improving the community of all
CC projects as a whole.

[projectroles]:/community/community-team/project-roles/
[communitybuildingroles]:/community/community-team/community-building-roles/

Each type has a few levels but that I'll just link them for you to read on your
own. While your eligibility for any role depends on how involved you have been
in the past, the role you choose reflects how involved you would like to be in
the future.

Start by asking yourself a simple question, "Do I code?"

#### "Sure, I can code..."

*That's awesome!* We have projects in a diverse array of languages, using myriad
tools and frameworks. Depending on the skills you have, or are planning to
acquire, you can pick a project and start contributing to it. Based on your
contributions and your familiarity with the codebase, you can then apply for the
role that matches your desired level of involvement.

So if you want to be lightly involved with code-reviews and would like to know
about our plans in advance, you can start off as a Project Contributor. This is
a fantastic role to get started with and ensures that you get excellent
mentorship as you start your FOSS journey.

As your familiarity with the codebase increases, you might want to triage
incoming issues or block certain PRs that you've reviewed. You could escalate
your role to Project Collaborator. Want to me more involved? You can apply to be
a Project Core Committer, or even a Project Maintainer.

While our goal is to equip as many people as possible with the skills to become
Project Maintainers, you are no-doubt free to de-escalate if you want to reduce
your involvement with the community.

#### "No, I can't code..."

*That's cool too!* We realise that open-source communities are never just about
the code. If you're passionate about growing the CC community by enabling new
contributors to get started or by spreading the word, you can apply for one of
the Community Building roles. Like the Project roles, there are a couple of
levels to choose from.

Community builders have a whole different set of responsibilities and privileges
specifically catered to the unique task of cultivating a healthy community
around our many open-source projects.

So if you want to be lightly involved with onboarding new contributors to the
repositories and the workflows, you could start off as a Community Contributor.
This is a fantastic role to help new contributors get a headstart in their
journey with FOSS.

As your familiarity with the community increases, you might want to suggest
tweets for our Twitter account, or pariticipate in long-term community building
tasks from Asana. You could escalate your role to Community Collaborator. Want
to me more involved? You can even apply to be a Community Maintainer.

While our goal is to equip as many people as possible with the skills to become
Community Maintainers, you are no-doubt free to de-escalate if you want to
reduce your involvement with the community.

Community Teams are a fairly novel idea for us and we're still tweaking things
along the way. Take our recent merge of two Project roles, namely Project Member
and Project Collaborator for example. We combined both when we realised they
weren't so different. As we internalise these roles more and more, we'll find
more scope for improvement and we'll continue to refine these roles over time.

We're excited about Community Teams. If you're interested in joining us on this
ride, it's really easy to [get started][communityteam].
