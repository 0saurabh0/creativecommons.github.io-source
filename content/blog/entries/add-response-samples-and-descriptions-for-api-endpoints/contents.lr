Well, hello again 👋! 

For week 3 and week 4, I added response samples and descriptions for API endpoints. Writing documentation feels a bit like coding at this point because I need to read a lot about drf-yasg, dig through issues and questions at Github / Stackoverflow to ensure that I don’t ask redundant (or even stupid) questions.

### Week 3

I was never a fan of odd numbers and the feeling seems mutual. Week 3 was quite hectic.
I moved back to my hometown during week 3. Took 3 days off to settle my stuff and set up a workspace. I worked on my GSoD project for only 2 days, Monday and Tuesday. I managed to create response samples for all API endpoints. Haven’t checked whether the documentation is being displayed as intended or not. Why? Because apparently Docker Desktop uses a lot of RAM (not this 🐏). My laptop has taken a lot of abuse throughout the years so I’m being gentle with it nowadays.

### Week 4

For this week, I reviewed what I’ve done and what I haven’t to estimate new completion time. Thank god, I have a buffer week in my GSoD timeline and deliverables. So yeah, all is good in terms of completion time. I discovered what causes the error in documentation and fixed it. I started to write descriptions for API endpoints.

Like the blog post? Gotta wait for 2 more weeks for another update, 😉!
